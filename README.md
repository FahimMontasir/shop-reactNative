## `technology`

I have used react native also react-native paper to build the UI really fast. For authentication and storing data, I have used firebase authentication and firebase firestore. And for styling the components I used styled components and react-navigation for routing.

You can see, there are five screens in the screens folder, two components in the component folder, all routes in the routes folder, and I create a backend folder for firebase setup and configuration.

## `core features`

At first, I want to tell the core feature of this app. and these are register screen where a user can create his account to get access to this app. after creating an account an user login with this account later. On the home screen, users will see all products and on the upload screen, a user can upload his product. lastly, in the account screen, he/she can see their added product and account information.

\*currently upload image function doesn't work
